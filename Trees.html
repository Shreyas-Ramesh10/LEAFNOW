    <h1>About Us</h1><br>
    <p style ="color:white">You probably already know that trees provide us with the oxygen we need to breathe, right? If not, then you do now. Trees also provide us with essential greenery and shade in our day-to-day lives, and a mental calm when we need a quiet escape from the city.

But why else do we need to plant even more trees? Is there a more global reason? An urgent reason to plant these environmental superheroes?

As it turns out, trees are essential for the wellbeing of just about every living being on our planet. And if you don’t believe that bold claim then, don’t worry, we think the following four factors will prove it to you.

*Reduced Green House Gases:
Trees naturally pull in carbon (and water) from the atmosphere to feed themselves. It’s just a happy coincidence that, in doing so, that process produces a pretty handy by-product: oxygen.

It goes without saying that oxygen is important. But the crucial takeaway is that trees absorb carbon and one of the biggest aspects of global warming is the rising amount of carbon dioxide trapped in our atmosphere.

Carbon dioxide is one of several greenhouse gases contributing to our rapid climate change. Since trees already absorb carbon, we need to plant even more to combat the effect it’s having on our planet. And we need to do it quickly – 11,000 scientists have declared that the planet is currently facing a “climate emergency.” If we plant more trees today, that means there will be less carbon and fewer greenhouse gases in our atmosphere.
